# Machine_Learning_Algorithms
Implementation of Following Machine Learning Algorithms using SckitLearn
1. Logistic Regression
2. K Means
3. Naive Bayes  (Gaussian NB, Bernoulli NB, Multinomial NB)

All these Algorithms are applied on Sample Datasets attached above. 

Implementaion of each Model Includes:

1. Data Loading
2. Data PreProcessing
3. Plotting Visualizations
4. Splitting the Dataset
4. Model Training
5. Compare Accuracy (F1 Score and Mean Squared Error if needed)
